# CoffeeRun
Getting coffee and breakfast in the morning is a common aspect of working early or in office spaces. Our goal with this application is to provide users with a simple and efficient way of finding nearby coffee locations and taking orders for their fellow co-workers. The app will be able to have co-workers update their orders live and notify the user of the closest locations to them.
